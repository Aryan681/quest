        <h1>Java Q&A</h1>
<hr>
<h1>2 marks</h1>
<hr>
        <div class="question">
            <h2>1. What is class in Java?</h2>
            <p>In Java, a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (fields) and
                behaviors (methods) that objects of that type will have.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>2. Write a Java program to print Fibonacci series.</h2>
            <p>This Java program prints the Fibonacci series up to a specified number of terms using loops or recursion,
                demonstrating algorithmic understanding and coding skills.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>3. How is Java different from C++?</h2>
            <p>Java differs from C++ in several ways, such as automatic memory management through garbage collection,
                absence of pointers, platform independence due to the Java Virtual Machine, and simpler syntax for
                certain features like generics.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>4. Discuss JDBC.</h2>
            <p>JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is an API that allows Java applications to interact with databases. It
                provides methods to establish connections, execute SQL queries, retrieve results, and handle
                transactions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>5. Is Multiple Inheritance executed in Java, if so how?</h2>
            <p>Multiple inheritance is not directly supported in Java due to the diamond problem. However, multiple
                interface inheritance is possible through interfaces, where a class can implement multiple interfaces.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>6. What is a Constructor in Java?</h2>
            <p>A constructor in Java is a special type of method that is automatically called when an object of a class
                is created. It initializes the newly created object.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>7. Why is Java a platform-independent language?</h2>
            <p>Java is platform-independent because it compiles code into bytecode, which can run on any system with a
                Java Virtual Machine (JVM), abstracting away hardware and operating system dependencies.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>8. Can the main method be overloaded in Java?</h2>
            <p>No, the main method in Java cannot be overloaded because it has a specific signature (public static void
                main(String[] args)) that is required for the JVM to recognize it as the entry point of the program.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>9. Differentiate the local from remote Applets.</h2>
            <p>Local applets run on the client machine, while remote applets are stored and executed on a server, with
                their results sent to the client. Remote applets offer greater security but require network access.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>10. What is the main objective of garbage collection?</h2>
            <p>The main objective of garbage collection in Java is to automatically reclaim memory occupied by objects
                that are no longer in use, preventing memory leaks and improving memory management efficiency.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>11. Why is the main method static?</h2>
            <p>The main method in Java is declared static to allow it to be called by the JVM without creating an
                instance of the class. This ensures that the main entry point of the program is accessible without
                object instantiation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>12. Compare and contrast process and thread.</h2>
            <p>A process is an independent unit of execution with its own memory space, while a thread is a lightweight
                process within a process. Processes have their own address space, whereas threads share the same address
                space.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>13. What is the ‘this’ keyword in Java?</h2>
            <p>The 'this' keyword in Java refers to the current instance of the class. It is used to differentiate
                between instance variables and parameters with the same name, and to invoke methods on the current
                object.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>14. Why is inheritance used in Java?</h2>
            <p>Inheritance is used in Java to create a new class (subclass) based on an existing class (superclass),
                allowing the subclass to inherit the properties and behaviors of the superclass, promoting code reuse
                and abstraction.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>15. Define multithreading.</h2>
            <p>Multithreading in Java allows concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single process, enabling
                efficient utilization of CPU resources and better responsiveness in applications.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>16. What is the difference between a JDK and a JRE?</h2>
            <p>JDK (Java Development Kit) includes tools for developing and running Java programs, while JRE (Java
                Runtime Environment) only includes the tools necessary for running Java programs, without development
                tools like compilers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>17. What is an exception?</h2>
            <p>An exception in Java is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the program's execution. It can occur
                due to various reasons, such as invalid input, file not found, or division by zero.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>18. Difference between interface and inheritance.</h2>
            <p>An interface in Java defines a contract for classes to implement, specifying method signatures without
                implementations, promoting loose coupling and multiple inheritance of type. Inheritance involves
                creating a subclass that inherits attributes and behaviors from a superclass.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>19. What are the two ways of implementing thread in Java?</h2>
            <p>Thread in Java can be implemented by extending the Thread class or implementing the Runnable interface.
                Extending the Thread class involves overriding the run() method, while implementing Runnable requires
                implementing the run() method.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>20. What is an interface?</h2>
            <p>An interface in Java is a reference type similar to a class that can contain only constants, method
                signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types. It provides a mechanism for achieving
                abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>21. Is Java a purely object-oriented language? Explain.</h2>
            <p>Java is not purely object-oriented because it supports primitive data types and static methods, which do
                not belong to objects. However, it follows the principles of object-oriented programming by emphasizing
                encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>22. Can we declare a main() method final?</h2>
            <p>No, the main() method in Java cannot be declared final because it must be overridden in subclasses for
                specific implementations, and final methods cannot be overridden.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>23. What is the reason behind declaring the main() method static?</h2>
            <p>The main() method in Java is declared static to allow it to be called by the JVM without creating an
                instance of the class. This ensures that the main entry point of the program is accessible without
                object instantiation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>24. Deduce the various stages of multithreading life cycle.</h2>
            <p>The multithreading life cycle in Java consists of several stages: new, runnable, blocked, waiting, timed
                waiting, and terminated. Threads transition between these stages based on their execution state and
                various thread operations.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>25. Explore the reason why char uses 2 bytes in Java and what is \u0000?</h2>
            <p>In Java, char uses 2 bytes to support Unicode characters, allowing it to represent a wider range of
                characters from different languages and scripts. \u0000 represents the null character in Unicode.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>26. List any two differences and similarities between Try….Catch and Throw…..Catch exceptions.</h2>
            <p><strong>Differences:</strong> Try-Catch is used to handle exceptions that occur within a block of code,
                while Throw-Catch is used to throw an exception explicitly and catch it in a separate block. Try-Catch
                blocks require a Catch or Finally block to handle exceptions, while Throw-Catch blocks only need a Catch
                block. <br><strong>Similarities:</strong> Both Try-Catch and Throw-Catch blocks are used for exception
                handling in Java. They prevent abnormal termination of the program by providing mechanisms to handle
                exceptions gracefully.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>27. Compare and contrast overloading with overriding.</h2>
            <p><strong>Overloading:</strong> Overloading involves defining multiple methods in the same class with the
                same name but different parameters. It is determined at compile-time based on the method signature.
                <br><strong>Overriding:</strong> Overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of
                a method that is already defined in its superclass. It is determined at runtime based on the actual
                object type. <br><strong>Similarities:</strong> Both overloading and overriding involve the creation of
                methods with the same name. They contribute to polymorphism in Java by allowing different behavior based
                on method signatures.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>28. Interpret any four reasons for using Java.</h2>
            <p>Four reasons for using Java include its platform independence, object-oriented paradigm, robustness, and
                extensive libraries. Java's platform independence allows for write once, run anywhere (WORA) capability,
                making it suitable for cross-platform development. Its object-oriented nature promotes code reusability,
                modularity, and scalability. Java's robustness is evident in its strong memory management, exception
                handling, and type safety features. Additionally, Java's vast standard libraries provide pre-built
                solutions for various tasks, reducing development time and effort.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>29. List any two similarities and differences between C++ and Java.</h2>
            <p><strong>Similarities:</strong> Both C++ and Java support object-oriented programming paradigms, including
                features like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism. Additionally, they use similar syntax for basic
                programming constructs like loops and conditionals. <br><strong>Differences:</strong> C++ supports
                multiple inheritance, while Java supports only single inheritance through classes. C++ provides manual
                memory management through pointers, whereas Java manages memory automatically through garbage
                collection. Additionally, Java requires all code to be inside classes, while C++ allows standalone
                functions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>30. Infer the reasons for using Servlets.</h2>
            <p>Servlets are used in Java web development for handling HTTP requests and generating dynamic web content.
                They provide a robust and scalable solution for server-side processing, allowing developers to create
                interactive and data-driven web applications. Servlets integrate seamlessly with Java Enterprise Edition
                (EE) technologies, such as JSP, JDBC, and EJBs, facilitating the development of enterprise-grade web
                applications.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>31. Is pointer concept available in Python? Validate it.</h2>
            <p>No, Python does not have a pointer concept like C or C++. Instead, it uses references to objects, which
                are automatically managed by the Python interpreter. Python emphasizes simplicity and readability over
                low-level memory manipulation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>32. Survey on AWT and Event handling bringing out any two similarities and differences between each.
            </h2>
            <p><strong>Similarities:</strong> Both AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) and event handling are used for
                creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Java. They provide mechanisms for responding to user
                interactions such as button clicks, mouse movements, and keyboard input.
                <br><strong>Differences:</strong> AWT provides platform-dependent components for building GUIs, while
                event handling involves registering event listeners and handling events triggered by user actions. AWT
                components are heavyweight, meaning they rely on the underlying platform's graphical resources, whereas
                event handling can be used with lightweight components like Swing.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>33. List the basic procedures and practices to build Object-oriented concepts with examples.</h2>
            <p>Basic procedures and practices for building object-oriented concepts include encapsulation, inheritance,
                and polymorphism. Encapsulation involves bundling data and methods within a class to restrict access and
                promote modularity. Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class,
                facilitating code reuse. Polymorphism enables objects to be treated as instances of their superclass,
                allowing for flexibility in method invocation and behavior. Examples include defining classes such as
                Vehicle, Car (subclass of Vehicle), and implementing methods like drive() to demonstrate inheritance and
                polymorphism.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>34. Outline the Swing classes.</h2>
            <p>Swing is a GUI toolkit in Java that provides a set of lightweight, platform-independent components for
                building desktop applications. Some key Swing classes include:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>JFrame:</strong> Used to create a top-level window with a title bar and border.</li>
                <li><strong>JButton:</strong> Used to create a clickable button component.</li>
                <li><strong>JLabel:</strong> Used to display text or an image on the GUI.</li>
                <li><strong>JTextField:</strong> Used to create a single-line text input field.</li>
                <li><strong>JTextArea:</strong> Used to create a multi-line text area for user input or display.</li>
                <li><strong>JTable:</strong> Used to display tabular data in rows and columns.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>35. Recall synchronization.</h2>
            <p>Synchronization in Java is used to control access to shared resources by multiple threads, preventing
                race conditions and ensuring thread safety. It involves using synchronized blocks or methods to
                coordinate thread execution. Synchronization can be applied to critical sections of code or shared data
                to ensure that only one thread can access them at a time, preventing inconsistencies and concurrency
                issues.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>36. Give the reasons for using String argvs[].</h2>
            <p>String argvs[] is used in the main method of Java programs to accept command-line arguments as an array
                of strings. It allows passing parameters to the program from the command line, enabling customization
                and configuration without modifying the source code. Command-line arguments can be used to provide input
                data, specify file paths, or configure application settings at runtime.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>37. Identify any two types of decision-making statements and also state its resulting outcome with
                examples.</h2>
            <p><strong>Types of decision-making statements:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>if-else statement:</strong> It executes a block of code based on a condition. If the
                    condition evaluates to true, the code inside the if block is executed; otherwise, the code inside
                    the else block (if present) is executed.
                    <pre><code>int x = 10;
if (x > 5) {
    System.out.println("x is greater than 5");
} else {
    System.out.println("x is less than or equal to 5");
}</code></pre>
                </li>
                <li><strong>switch statement:</strong> It provides a more efficient way to select among multiple
                    options. It evaluates an expression and compares it with case labels to determine the appropriate
                    block of code to execute.
                    <pre><code>int day = 3;
switch (day) {
    case 1:
        System.out.println("Sunday");
        break;
    case 2:
        System.out.println("Monday");
        break;
    // More cases...
    default:
        System.out.println("Invalid day");
}</code></pre>
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>38. Find out the end results of using the unary operators in an example.</h2>
            <p>Unary operators in Java perform operations on a single operand, resulting in specific end results based
                on the operator used. For example:
            <pre><code>int x = 5;
x++; // Increment x by 1
System.out.println(x); // Output: 6

boolean flag = true;
System.out.println(!flag); // Output: false</code></pre>
            In this example, the ++ operator increments the value of the variable <code>x</code> by 1, while the !
            operator negates the boolean value <code>flag</code>, resulting in <code>false</code>.

            <h2>39. Propose any example using Java package explaining when to use packages.</h2>
            <p>Packages in Java are used to organize classes and interfaces into namespaces, preventing naming conflicts
                and improving code maintainability. For example, in a banking application, different packages can be
                created for customer management, transactions, and accounts.
            <pre><code>package com.example.bank;
public class Account {
    // Account class implementation
}</code></pre>
            This example demonstrates the usage of a package <code>com.example.bank</code> to encapsulate the
            <code>Account</code> class, making it easier to manage and locate related classes within the project
            structure.

            <h2>40. Tell the alternate name of “compile-time polymorphism” specifying an example for it.</h2>
            <p>Compile-time polymorphism in Java is also known as method overloading, where multiple methods in the same
                class have the same name but different parameters. For example:
            <pre><code>class Calculator {
    public void add(int a, int b) {

    }

    public void add(double a, double b) {
        System.out.println("Sum: " + (a + b));
}</code></pre>
            Here, the <code>add</code> method is overloaded with different parameter types (int and double), allowing
            for flexibility in method invocation.

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Implicit import:</strong> Java automatically imports classes from the <code>java.lang</code>
                    package, allowing their use without explicit import statements. For example:
                    <pre><code>String str = "Hello";</code></pre>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Explicit import:</strong> Explicit import statements are used to import classes from other
                    packages into the current source file. They precede the class declaration and specify the fully
                    qualified class name. For example:
                    <pre><code>import java.util.ArrayList;</code></pre>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Implicit casting (Widening):</strong> It occurs when the destination data type can hold all
                    possible values of the source data type. No explicit casting is required. For example:
                    <pre><code>int x = 10;
double y = x; // Implicit casting from int to double</code></pre>
                </li>

                    all possible values of the source data type. Explicit casting is required to avoid loss of
                    precision. For example:

            <h2>1. Exception Handling in Java (15 marks)</h2>
            <p>Exception handling in Java is a crucial aspect of writing robust and reliable code. It provides a
                mechanism to gracefully handle runtime errors, preventing abrupt termination of the program. In Java,
                exceptions are objects that represent the occurrence of an exceptional condition, such as division by
                zero, array index out of bounds, or file not found.</p>

            <p>The significance of exception handling lies in its ability to separate error-handling code from normal
                program logic, enhancing the maintainability and readability of the codebase. By catching and handling
                exceptions, developers can ensure that their programs continue to execute smoothly, even in the presence
                of unexpected errors.</p>

            <p>One of the key constructs for exception handling in Java is the try-catch block. Within a try block,
                developers can enclose code that may potentially throw an exception. If an exception occurs within the
                try block, control is transferred to the corresponding catch block, where the exception can be caught
                and handled appropriately.</p>

            <pre><code>try {
    // Risky code that may throw an exception
    int result = 10 / 0; // This will throw an ArithmeticException
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    // Handle the ArithmeticException
    System.out.println("Error: Division by zero");
}</code></pre>

            <p>In the above example, the division by zero operation within the try block will throw an
                <code>ArithmeticException</code>. This exception is caught in the catch block, where an error message is
                printed to the console.</p>

            <p>Another important aspect of exception handling in Java is the use of checked and unchecked exceptions.
                Checked exceptions are those that must be declared in the method signature or caught using a try-catch
                block, while unchecked exceptions (also known as runtime exceptions) do not require explicit handling.
            </p>

            <p>Finally, the <code>finally</code> block provides a mechanism to execute cleanup code, regardless of
                whether an exception occurs. This is useful for releasing resources or performing other necessary
                cleanup tasks.</p>

            <p>In summary, exception handling in Java is significant for writing robust and reliable code by gracefully
                handling runtime errors. Through constructs like try-catch blocks, checked and unchecked exceptions, and
                finally blocks, developers can ensure that their programs handle exceptions effectively, thereby
                enhancing the overall stability and reliability of the software.</p>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>2. Java Interface Concept (15 marks)</h2>
            <p>In Java, an interface is a reference type that defines a set of abstract methods. Unlike classes, interfaces cannot contain method implementations; they only define method signatures. Interfaces play a crucial role in achieving abstraction and providing a contract for classes to adhere to.</p>

            <p>The interface concept is significant in Java for several reasons. Firstly, it enables the implementation of multiple inheritance of type. Unlike classes, which can only inherit from a single superclass, a class can implement multiple interfaces. This allows for greater flexibility in designing class hierarchies and promotes code reuse.</p>

            <p>Secondly, interfaces facilitate abstraction by defining a common set of methods that classes implementing the interface must provide. This allows developers to work with objects at a higher level of abstraction, focusing on what objects can do rather than how they do it.</p>

            <pre><code>interface Shape {
    double area();
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    private double radius;

    public Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    @Override
    public double area() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}</code></pre>

            <p>In the above example, the <code>Shape</code> interface defines a single method, <code>area()</code>, which calculates the area of a shape. The <code>Circle</code> class implements the <code>Shape</code> interface and provides an implementation for the <code>area()</code> method, calculating the area of a circle based on its radius.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, interfaces facilitate loose coupling and promote code extensibility. By programming to interfaces rather than concrete implementations, developers can write more modular and flexible code that is easier to maintain and extend.</p>

            <p>In summary, the interface concept in Java is significant for achieving abstraction, multiple inheritance of type, and promoting code reuse and extensibility. By defining contracts for classes to implement, interfaces enable the creation of more modular, flexible, and maintainable codebases.</p>

            <h2> 3. Hybrid Inheritance in Java (15 marks)</h2>
            <p>Hybrid inheritance in Java involves a combination of single, multiple, and hierarchical inheritance. While Java does not support multiple inheritance of classes, it does allow multiple inheritance of interfaces, which can lead to hybrid inheritance scenarios.</p>
        
            <p>Single inheritance refers to the ability of a class to inherit from only one superclass. This forms a hierarchical relationship between classes, with subclasses inheriting properties and behaviors from their superclass.</p>
        
            <p>Multiple inheritance, on the other hand, refers to the ability of a class to inherit from multiple superclasses. This can lead to the diamond problem, where a subclass inherits from two or more superclasses that have a common superclass. To avoid this issue, Java prohibits multiple inheritance of classes but allows multiple inheritance of interfaces.</p>
        
            <p>Hybrid inheritance arises when a class inherits from both classes and interfaces, resulting in a combination of single and multiple inheritance. This allows for greater flexibility in designing class hierarchies and promoting code reuse.</p>
        
            <pre><code>interface A {
            void methodA();
        }
        
        interface B {
            void methodB();
        }
        
        class C implements A, B {
            @Override
            public void methodA() {
                // Implementation of methodA
            }
        
            @Override
            public void methodB() {
                // Implementation of methodB
            }
        }</code></pre>
        
            <p>In the above example, the class <code>C</code> implements both interfaces <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, thereby achieving multiple inheritance of type. It provides implementations for the <code>methodA()</code> and <code>methodB()</code> methods defined in the interfaces <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, respectively.</p>
        
            <p>Hybrid inheritance allows developers to leverage the benefits of both single and multiple inheritance while avoiding the complexities associated with multiple inheritance of classes. It promotes code reuse, modularity, and flexibility in designing class hierarchies.</p>
        
            <p>In summary, hybrid inheritance in Java enables classes to inherit properties and behaviors from both classes and interfaces, leading to more flexible and modular class hierarchies. By combining the benefits of single and multiple inheritance, hybrid inheritance promotes code reuse and extensibility.</p>

            <h2>7.Discussing Different Exception Handling Concepts with Illustrations:</h2>
            <p>Exception handling is integral to writing robust and reliable Java programs. Let's explore various concepts along with practical illustrations.</p>
            
            <!-- 1. try-catch Blocks -->
            <h3>1. try-catch Blocks:</h3>
            <p>Use try-catch blocks to catch exceptions and handle them gracefully.</p>
            <pre><code>try {
            // Risky code
        } catch (ExceptionType e) {
            // Handling code
        }</code></pre>
            
            <!-- 2. Checked and Unchecked Exceptions -->
            <h3>2. Checked and Unchecked Exceptions:</h3>
            <p>Java differentiates between checked and unchecked exceptions. Checked exceptions must be either caught or declared in the method signature, while unchecked exceptions need not be explicitly handled.</p>
            <pre><code>// Checked exception
        try {
            FileReader file = new FileReader("file.txt");
        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
            // Handling code
        }
        
        // Unchecked exception
        int result = 10 / 0; // ArithmeticException</code></pre>
            
            <!-- 3. Finally Block -->
            <h3>3. Finally Block:</h3>
            <p>The finally block executes cleanup code, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not.</p>
            <pre><code>try {
            // Risky code
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // Handling code
        } finally {
            // Cleanup code
        }</code></pre>
            
            <!-- 4. Custom Exceptions -->
            <h3>4. Custom Exceptions:</h3>
            <p>Create custom exception classes to handle specific error conditions.</p>
            <pre><code>class MyException extends Exception {
            public MyException(String message) {
                super(message);
            }
        }
        
        try {
            // Risky code
            throw new MyException("Custom exception occurred");
        } catch (MyException e) {
            // Handling code
        }</code></pre>
            
            <p>By mastering these exception handling concepts, developers can write more resilient and error-tolerant Java applications.</p>

    <h2>6. Explaining the Thread Life Cycle with Examples:</h2>
    <p>Threads in Java undergo a predefined life cycle, progressing through different states. Let's explore each state and its significance with examples.</p>
    
    <!-- New State -->
    <h3>New State:</h3>
    <p>A thread enters the new state when it's instantiated but not yet started.</p>
    <pre><code>Thread thread = new Thread();</code></pre>
    
    <!-- Runnable State -->
    <h3>Runnable State:</h3>
    <p>A thread enters the runnable state when it's ready to run but waiting for CPU time.</p>
    <pre><code>Thread thread = new Thread(() -&gt; {
    // Thread code
});
thread.start();</code></pre>
    
    <!-- Running State -->
    <h3>Running State:</h3>
    <p>A thread enters the running state when it's executing its code.</p>
    <pre><code>Thread thread = new Thread(() -&gt; {
    // Thread code
});
thread.start();</code></pre>
    
    <!-- Blocked State -->
    <h3>Blocked State:</h3>
    <p>A thread enters the blocked state when it's waiting for a resource, such as I/O or synchronization lock.</p>
    <pre><code>synchronized (lock) {
    // Code requiring lock
}</code></pre>
    
    <!-- Waiting State -->
    <h3>Waiting State:</h3>
    <p>A thread enters the waiting state when it's waiting indefinitely for another thread to notify it.</p>
    <pre><code>synchronized (lock) {
    lock.wait();
}</code></pre>
    
    <!-- Timed Waiting State -->
    <h3>Timed Waiting State:</h3>
    <p>A thread enters the timed waiting state when it's waiting for a specified duration.</p>
    <pre><code>synchronized (lock) {
    lock.wait(timeout);
}</code></pre>
    
    <!-- Terminated State -->
    <h3>Terminated State:</h3>
    <p>A thread enters the terminated state when its run method completes or when an uncaught exception terminates it.</p>
    <pre><code>Thread thread = new Thread(() -&gt; {
    // Thread code
});
thread.start();</code></pre>
    
    <p>Understanding the thread life cycle is crucial for writing multithreaded applications in Java, ensuring efficient and synchronized execution of concurrent tasks.</p>

        <h2>1. Explain multi-threading using an interface</h2>
        <p>In Java, multithreading can be achieved using the <code>Runnable</code> interface. The <code>Runnable</code> interface represents a task that can be executed by a thread. To use it, a class needs to implement the <code>Runnable</code> interface and override its <code>run</code> method. Here’s an example:</p>
        <pre><code>
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " - " + i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}

public class MultiThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}

    <div class="question">
        <h2>2. What is the Java 'instanceof' operator? Explain with an example</h2>
        <p>The <code>instanceof</code> operator in Java is used to test whether an object is an instance of a specific class or subclass. It helps in ensuring that an object is of the type you expect before performing operations on it.</p>
        <pre><code>
class Animal {}
class Dog extends Animal {}

public class InstanceofExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myDog = new Dog();
        
        if (myDog instanceof Dog) {
            System.out.println("myDog is an instance of Dog");
        } else {
            System.out.println("myDog is not an instance of Dog");

    <div class="question">
        <h2>3. Explain the concept of polymorphism with the help of an example</h2>
        <p>Polymorphism in Java allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. It is mainly achieved through method overriding and interfaces.</p>
        <pre><code>
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows");
    }
}

public class PolymorphismExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myAnimal = new Dog();
        myAnimal.sound(); // Outputs: Dog barks

        myAnimal = new Cat();
        myAnimal.sound(); // Outputs: Cat meows
    }

    <div class="question">
        <h2>4. What is method overriding? Explain with an example</h2>
        <p>Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass.</p>
        <pre><code>
class Parent {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Display in Parent");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Display in Child");

    <div class="question">
        <h2>5. What is a String? Explain the functions of String with examples</h2>
        <p>In Java, a <code>String</code> is an object that represents a sequence of characters. Strings are immutable, meaning once created, their values cannot be changed.</p>
        <pre><code>
public class StringExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = "Hello, World!";
        System.out.println("Length: " + str.length());
        System.out.println("Char at index 1: " + str.charAt(1));
        System.out.println("Substring: " + str.substring(7, 12));
        System.out.println("Uppercase: " + str.toUpperCase());
        System.out.println("Contains 'World': " + str.contains("World"));
        System.out.println("Replace 'World' with 'Java': " + str.replace("World", "Java"));

    <div class="question">
        <h2>6. What is the use of the 'final' keyword in Java? Explain with an example</h2>
        <p>The <code>final</code> keyword in Java is used to declare constants, prevent method overriding, and inheritance.</p>
        <pre><code>
final class FinalClass {
    final int constant = 10;
    
    final void show() {
        System.out.println("This is a final method.");
    }
}

// This will cause a compile-time error
// class SubClass extends FinalClass {}

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FinalClass obj = new FinalClass();
        System.out.println("Constant value: " + obj.constant);

        <h2>7. What are the differences between Heap and Stack Memory in Java?</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Stack Memory:</strong><br>
            - Used for static memory allocation.<br>
            - Stores method calls, local variables, and references.<br>
            - Memory is automatically allocated and deallocated when methods are called and return.<br>
            - Operates on a Last In, First Out (LIFO) basis.<br>
            - Faster access but limited in size.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Heap Memory:</strong><br>
            - Used for dynamic memory allocation.<br>
            - Stores objects and arrays.<br>
            - Memory needs to be managed using garbage collection.<br>
            - Larger size and slower access compared to stack.<br>
            - Accessible from anywhere in the application.<br>
        </p>
        <pre><code>
public class MemoryExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
